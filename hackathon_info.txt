Requirements
What to Build
The only limit is your imagination. Design intelligent dining experiences like AI-powered meal planners that suggest restaurants based on dietary preferences and cuisine exploration goals. Create nightlife guides that match users with venues based on music taste, atmosphere, and real-time crowd insights. Build smart home service platforms connecting homeowners with trusted contractors through AI-driven matching. Develop travel companions that craft personalized itineraries blending food, activities, and hidden gems. Think beyond search ro consider voice-activated assistants, AR experiences overlaying business info on city streets, or social platforms for sharing local recommendations. Your app should make discovering and experiencing local businesses more intuitive, personalized, and delightful than ever before.

What to Submit
Your submission must include a NEW web or mobile application using Yelp AI API endpoint as the primary data source, with a public code repository containing all source code and setup instructions. Provide a URL to a hosted build (APK/TestFlight) or published app for testing. Include a three-minute demonstration video (YouTube, Vimeo, or similar) showing your app in action, plus a detailed text description explaining features and functionality. Enter your Yelp AI API client ID generated during sign-up. Ensure your project meets technical requirements: thoroughly leverages Yelp AI API, functions as demonstrated, and represents original work created during the submission period

Body Params
query
string
required
length ≤ 1000
• Natural language text for querying Yelp-specific information.
• Accepts any prompt related to Yelp businesses, such as “Can you find a Thai restaurant near me?”
• This should be plain text (no special formatting needed).

chat_id
string
• Uniquely identifies the current conversation (chat session).
• For the first request, set this to null or omit it; the API will respond with a new chat_id.
• Use the returned chat_id on subsequent requests to continue the same conversation.
• If omitted on subsequent requests, a new conversation is started.
• If an invalid chat_id is provided, the request will fail.

user_context
object
Contains optional location data (latitude and longitude) that can help the AI
tailor results to a user’s location. If not provided and a location-based query
is asked, the system may prompt the user to specify a location.


user_context object
latitude
float
-3.402823669209385e+38 to 3.402823669209385e+38
• User’s approximate latitude.
• If provided, it helps return more location-specific results.
• Otherwise, the system may ask for location details if needed (e.g., for searches).

longitude
float
-3.402823669209385e+38 to 3.402823669209385e+38
• User's approximate longitude.
• If provided, it helps return more location-specific results.
• Otherwise, the system may ask for location details if needed.

request_context
object
Contains optional settings that control how the API processes the request.
These settings affect the response format and content generation behavior.


request_context object
skip_text_generation
boolean
Defaults to false
• When set to true, skips LLM text generation and returns only structured data.
• The response will contain empty text and tags, but all structured data
(businesses, entities, types) will still be returned.
• Useful for clients that only need structured data and want to reduce latency.

Getting Started with Yelp AI API
This guide will walk you through the steps needed to integrate the Yelp AI API API into your application, leveraging best practices for a smooth developer experience. We will cover how to make your first API endpoint request, receive a response, and how to manage session state across subsequent requests.

Introduction
The Yelp AI API enables developers to build conversational experiences for local business discovery. Whether you're developing a chatbot, integrating into voice assistants or enhancing your app with smart local business recommendations, Yelp AI API provides flexible and power capabilities. The API takes in natural language inquiries and provides natural language responses along with structured data for additional context (e.g., location-based search results & business details).

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:

A Yelp Places API account, and an API key for authentication. Refer to Yelp Places Authentication for further details.
Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and JSON.
A development environment (such as curl, Postman, or a client library in your preferred programming language) to send HTTP requests.
Making Your First API Request
Your first request does not need to include a chat_id. You can simply send a payload similar to the one below. The API endpoint will handle the conversation state internally and return a chat_id in the response, which you can use in subsequent calls for that user session.

Example Request (first request):

json

POST https://api.yelp.com/ai/chat/v2
Authorization: Bearer <Your API Key>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "What's a good vegan pizza place near me?",
  "user_context": {
    "locale": "en_US",
    "latitude": 40.7128,
    "longitude": -74.0060
  }
}
Explanation
query: The user’s natural-language request or query.
user_context: Optional but highly recommended context, such as the user’s locale and/or location coordinates.
A successful response includes the AI’s textual output and may also contain structured data relevant to the response. Below is an example showing a typical response with business recommendations:

JSON

{
    "response": {
        "text": "I found a few great vegan pizza options nearby. Double Zero is a fully vegan pizzeria with cashew cheese and truffle pizzas and a trendy vibe. Norm's Pizza offers naturally leavened dough and classic NY-style slices, while Underground Pizza features gluten-free and keto options with a crispy thin crust. Double Zero is 100% plant-based, while the others have vegan-friendly choices.",

Important Fields
response.text: The AI’s primary response in natural language.
types: Contextual tags indicating the nature of the response (here, "business_search").
entities: Structured data containing relevant entities. In the example, this includes an array of businesses.
contextual_info.summary: A contextually relevant, AI-generated summary of the business based on the user's query.
summaries: Provides different levels of detail about the business, including a short, medium, and long description. This allows developers to choose the appropriate level of detail depending on their use case, such as quick previews for chatbots or full descriptions for business profiles.
review_snippet: A highlighted snippet from a user review.
chat_id: The identifier for your conversation. Use this in further requests to continue the same conversation context.
Visit the Yelp AI API Reference page for detailed information on the fields returned by the API endpoint.


Example 2: Business Question and Response
After you complete your first request, the response’s chat_id should be included in each subsequent request for that user's session. This helps the Yelp AI API maintain context and continuity across multiple queries.

Example Request (subsequent requests):

JSON

POST https://api.yelp.com/ai/chat/v2
Authorization: Bearer <Your API Key>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "What are their opening hours?",
  "chat_id": "qs_MyS18PQJms3p5xdeVpQ"
}
Providing the chat_id into your requests ensures the AI knows you're continuing the same conversation. This way, the system can provide an informed response based on your prior interactions.

Example Response:

JSON

{
    "response": {
        "text": "Double Zero is open daily from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM (Friday and Saturday until 1:00 AM). Norm's Pizza is open Monday to Saturday 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM and Sunday 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Underground Pizza is open Monday to Friday 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM and Saturday 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM.",
